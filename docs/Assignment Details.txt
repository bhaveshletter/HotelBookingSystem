The hotel allows booking up to 6 months in advance for room reservations and needs an easy way for the user to book room if a particular category of room is available for a given date range.

Write an api which shows availability of room by passing booking date and or room type.  Second if user is registered he can see his booked room and booking information

Your code needs to be efficient in querying. Make suitable assumptions where needed. Comment your code to highlight the design decisions.
